coefficient patterns. Uses Simpson's rule for accurate integration.

# Generate data with binomial response and saddle-shaped coefficient surface
data <- data_generator_po_2d(n = 2, response_type = "binomial", beta_type = "saddle")

# Generate data with fixed stochastic components
data <- data_generator_po_2d(n = 2, a1 = 0.1, a2 = -0.2)
