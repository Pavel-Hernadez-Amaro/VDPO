Description: The VDPO package offers a comprehensive set of tools for analyzing
  and manipulating functional data with non-uniform lengths. This package 
  addresses two common scenarios in functional data analysis: Variable Domain
  Data, where the observation domain differs across samples, and Partially Observed
  Data, where observations are incomplete over the domain of interest. 
  VDPO enhances the flexibility and applicability of functional data analysis in R.
